abstract: Force Myography (FMG) is a method of tracking functional motor
  activity using volumetric changes associated with muscle function. With
  comparable accuracy and multiple advantages over traditional methods of
  functional motor activity tracking, FMG has shown promising potential in terms
  of applications in human-machine interfaces, teleoperation and healthcare
  devices. This paper provides a study that explores the effect of the spatial
  coverage and placement of the Force Myography (FMG) measurements on the
  accuracy and predictability of the machine learning models of isometric hand
  force. Five participants were recruited in this study and were asked to exert
  isometric force along three perpendicular axes while wearing custom-built FMG
  devices. During the tests, the isometric force was measured using a 6
  degree-of-freedom (DOF) load cell whereas the FMG signals were recorded using
  a total number of 60 FSRs, which were embedded into four bands worn on the
  arm. General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model was employed in this study
  for predicting the hand force in three axes from the recorded FMG signals. The
  regression model was trained using all possible band combinations to find the
  optimal placement for the FMG measurements. The results showed that the
  accuracy significantly improved when increasing the spatial coverage from 1
  FMG band to 2 or 3 bands for all axes. While the accuracy slightly improved
  when the 4 bands used instead of 3. Specifically, the average R 2 across all
  subjects and axes are 0.68 ± 0.12, 0.84 ± 0.04, 0.91 ± 0.02 and 0.95 ± 0.01
  using single, double, triple and four bands combination, respectively, in
  5-fold cross-validation evaluation. The knowledge generated from this work
  aims serve as a guide towards the development of portable FMG based technology
  for widespread deployment in the general population.
