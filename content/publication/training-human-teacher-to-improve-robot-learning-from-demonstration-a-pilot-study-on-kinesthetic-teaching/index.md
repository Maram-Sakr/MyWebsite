abstract: Robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD) allows robots to implement
  autonomous manipulation by observing the movements executed by a demonstrator.
  As such, LfD has been established as a key element for useful user
  interactions in everyday environments. Kinesthetic teaching, a teaching
  technique within LfD, entails physically guiding the robot to achieve a task.
  When demonstrating complex actions on a multi-DoF manipulator, novice users
  typically encounter difficulties with trajectory continuity and joint
  orientation, necessitating training by an expert. A comparison between
  different training approaches is conducted in a study of nine novice users.
  These approaches are kinesthetic, observational and discovery-learning. The
  kinesthetic method utilizes record and playback functions implemented on a
  7-DoF Barrett Technology WAM robot. A novice user passively holds the arm
  while an expert's trajectory is replayed. A visual demonstration by the expert
  is used for the observational training group. The discovery-learning group
  does not receive an expert demonstration; they use trial-and-error to produce
  the trajectory on their own. Task-space performance is evaluated pre- and
  post-training for each user to determine the relative and absolute performance
  improvements of the groups across the three training approaches. Absolute
  performance improvements are compared to the performance of an expert and a
  minimum-jerk trajectory to gauge how skillful the participant becomes with
  respect to the expert. The kinesthetic approach shows superior indicators of
  performance in trajectory similarity to the minimum-jerk trajectory with 39%
  and 13% improvement over the observational and discovery methods,
  respectively. Observational training shows greater improvement in terms of the
  smoothness of the velocity profile with 32.7% compared to 29.5% and 21.9% for
  both discovery and kinesthetic training, respectively.
