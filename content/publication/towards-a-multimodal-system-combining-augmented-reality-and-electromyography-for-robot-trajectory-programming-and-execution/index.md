abstract: Programming and executing robot trajectories is a routine
  manufacturing procedure. However, current interfaces (i.e., teach pendants)
  are bulky, unintuitive, and interrupts task flow. Recently, augmented reality
  (AR) has been used to create alternative solutions. However, input modalities
  of such systems tend to be limited. By introducing the use of electromyography
  (EMG), we have created a novel multimodal wearable interface for online
  trajectory programming and execution. Through the use of EMG, our system aims
  to bridge the user's force activation to the robot arm force profile. Our
  proposed system provides two interaction methods for trajectory execution and
  force control using 1) arm EMG and 2) arm orientation. We compared these
  methods with a standard joystick in a user study to test their usability.
  Results show that proposed methods have increased physical demands but yield
  equivalent task performance, demonstrating the potential of our proposed
  interface to provide a wearable alternative solution.
