abstract: Robot teleoperation is crucial for many hazardous situations such as
  handling radioactive materials, undersea exploration and firefighting. Visual
  feedback is essential to increase the operator's situation awareness and thus
  accurately teleoperate a robot. In addition, the control interface is equally
  important as the visual feedback for effective teleoperation. In this paper,
  we propose a simple and cost-effective orthographic visual interface for the
  teleoperation system by visualizing the remote environment to provide depth
  information using only a single inexpensive webcam. Further, we provide a
  simple modification to the control interface (Leap Motion) to achieve a wider
  workspace and make it more convenient for the user. To realize the merits of
  the proposed system, a comparison between the modified Leap Motion interface
  and traditional control modalities (i.e., joystick and keyboard) is conducted
  using both the proposed orthographic vision system and a traditional binocular
  vision system. We conduct a user study (N = 10) to evaluate the effectiveness
  of this approach to teleoperate a 6-DoF arm robot to carry out a pick and
  place task. The results show that the combination of Leap Motion with the
  orthographic visual system outperforms all other combinations.
