abstract: We propose a modification of a well-known ant-inspired trail-following
  algorithm to reduce congestion in multi-robot systems. Our method results in
  robots moving in multiple lanes towards their goal location. Our algorithm is
  inspired by the idea of building multiple-lane highways to mitigate traffic
  congestion in traffic engineering. We consider the resource transportation
  task where autonomous robots repeatedly transport goods between a food source
  and a nest in an initially unknown environment. To evaluate our algorithm, we
  perform simulation experiments in several environments with and without
  obstacles. Compared with the baseline SO-LOST algorithm, we find that our
  modified method increases the system throughput by up to 3.9 times by
  supporting a larger productive robot population.
