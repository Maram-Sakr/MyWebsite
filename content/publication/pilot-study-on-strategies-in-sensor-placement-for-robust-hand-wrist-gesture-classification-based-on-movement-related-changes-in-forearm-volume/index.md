abstract: Force Myography (FMG) is novel method of tracking functional motor
  activity using volumetric changes associated with muscle function. With
  comparable accuracy and multiple advantages over traditional methods of
  functional motor activity tracking, FMG has made leaps and bounds in terms of
  applications in human-machine interfaces and healthcare devices. As a field
  that is rapidly gaining popularity in health innovation, the aim of this paper
  is to contribute to our understanding of the nature FMG methods and establish
  it as a robust and reliable technique. The main point of exploration for this
  study is the impact of sensor placement and spatial coverage on FMG methods.
  Five participants were invited to perform a series of isolated wrist motions
  and hand gestures while wearing custom-built FMG devices. Linear Discriminant
  Analysis (LDA) machine learning models were developed using 80% of the data
  for training and 20% for testing. Overall, the accuracy of the LDA models
  ranged from 75% to 100% across all subjects and dimensions of FMG data. The
  model accuracy improved when increasing the spatial coverage from 1 FMG band
  to 2, but it did not increase further with additions. The results also showed
  that the improved accuracy offered by a large spatial coverage of FMG data can
  be approximated by lower spatial coverage if sensors were placed in an optimal
  location. This location was indicated to be midway between the wrist and the
  collective muscle bellies of intrinsic forearm muscles. The knowledge
  generated from this work aims serve as a guide towards the development of
  portable FMG based technology for widespread deployment in the general
  population. The hope is that the long-term benefits of continued FMG research
  will address issues in healthcare-associated with disparities in access to
  medical technologies.
