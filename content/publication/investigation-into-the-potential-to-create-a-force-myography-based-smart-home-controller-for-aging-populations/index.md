abstract: Force Myography (FMG) quantifies the volumetric changes in a limb
  occurring with muscle contraction and can potentially be used to design
  convenient, low-cost interfaces to assist in activities of daily living (ADL).
  The aim of this study is to evaluate whether elders can effectively use an
  FMG-based wrist band to interact with their environment. In this regard, an
  FMG band consisted of an array of force-sensing resistors (FSRs) was designed.
  Ten participants were grouped in two classes, namely “senior” and
  “non-senior”, and were instructed to perform control gestures and
  unconstrained ADL tasks while wearing the designed wrist band. To evaluate the
  usability of the band, correct identification of hand gestures and reaction
  times were noted. Results showed that seniors were capable of successfully
  performing a control gesture within 1.4 s of displaying the instruction during
  online testing. The individually-trained gesture identification algorithm
  achieved an accuracy of 76.5% in this case. Non-seniors had a reaction time of
  0.9 s with an overall classification accuracy of 91.2%. This preliminary study
  demonstrates the potential and feasibility of utilizing FMG-based technology
  to provide elders with assistance during activities of daily living.
