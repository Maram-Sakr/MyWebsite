abstract: "Human-machine-interfaces (HMI) have a key role for translating human
  intention into control commands to external devices. Different wearable
  techniques, including surface electromyography (sEMG), have been proposed for
  acquiring bio-signals that reveal the human intention. In this paper, we
  explore an easy-to-use wearable sensor device that can be used to measure
  force-myography (FMG) signals. We assess if FMG signals can be used to
  estimate isometric torque of hand pronation-supination, wrist
  flexion-extension, or wrist radial-ulnar using a regression model. Results of
  our investigation report an average accuracy over 90%. The related standard
  deviation of 0.02 is showing consistency of data among different data
  collecting sessions. The proposed FMG-based device shows therefore promising
  performance for different future applications, which may include: monitoring
  the progress of patients during exercising in arm rehabilitation programs;
  proportional control of robotic hand prosthesis; and control of robot
  movements."
