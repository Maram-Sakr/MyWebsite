abstract: Researchers in biomechanics, neuroscience, human–machine interaction
  and other fields are interested in inferring human intentions and objectives
  from observed actions. The problem of inferring objectives from observations
  has received extensive theoretical and methodological development from both
  the controls and machine learning communities. In this paper, we provide an
  integrating view of objective learning from human demonstration data. We
  differentiate algorithms based on the assumptions made about the objective
  function structure, how the similarity between the inferred objectives and the
  observed demonstrations is assessed, the assumptions made about the agent and
  environment model, and the properties of the observed human demonstrations. We
  review the application domains and validation approaches of existing works and
  identify the key open challenges and limitations. The paper concludes with an
  identification of promising directions for future work.
