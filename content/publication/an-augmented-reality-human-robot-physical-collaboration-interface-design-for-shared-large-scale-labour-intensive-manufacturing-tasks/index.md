abstract: We present an augmented reality (AR) based interface targeted for
  programming and collaborating with industrial robots on large-scale
  labour-intensive manufacturing tasks. While it has been shown that the use of
  AR can help reduce execution times in cases involving smaller-scale tasks, its
  use for large-scale workpiece manufacturing requiring high levels of human
  worker labour has not been well studied. With the end goal of applying our AR
  system for aircraft body manufacturing, we compare in a user study the use of
  our AR interface with a standard joystick for a simulated large-scale
  carbon-fibre-reinforced-polymer manufacturing procedure. Results show that our
  AR system yields reduced task completion time and physical demand from the
  user. We also show that acceptance and adoption of a robot assistant may
  depend on the user interface, and that our AR interface promotes robot
  utilization and encourages human-robot collaboration.
