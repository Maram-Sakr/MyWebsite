abstract: "Much of the morbidity and disability associated with industrial work
  settings arise from accidents involving humans and robots. Force Myography
  (FMG) is a potential technique to be used as an additional control measure for
  safer human-robot interaction without the need for robot hardware modification
  or replacement. The FMG signals represent the volumetric changes in the
  forearm due to muscle contraction, which were acquired using a Force Sensitive
  Resistor strap. A 1DOF torque sensor was used to model the point of
  interaction between a robot and a human. The following isolated upper
  extremity movements were considered: forearm pronation-supination, wrist
  flexion-extension and wrist radial-ulnar deviation. Torque regression models
  based on FMG data were created with two machine learning methods: Support
  Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Performance indices
  were defined and used for the comparative study between the two learning
  methods. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using FMG to estimate
  torque with accuracies around 90%. Both methods also demonstrated strong
  intra- and inter- participant consistency of FMG signals. The results will be
  beneficial for measuring the contact force between human and robot during
  their interaction."
