abstract = {Robot learning from demonstration (LfD) is a common approach that allows robots to perform tasks after observing teacher's demonstrations. Thus, users without a robotics background could use LfD to teach robots. However, such users may provide low-quality demonstrations. Besides, demonstration quality plays a crucial role in robot learning and generalization. Hence, it is important to ensure quality demonstrations before using them for robot learning. This abstract proposes an approach for quantifying demonstration quality which in turn enhances robot learning and generalization.},
