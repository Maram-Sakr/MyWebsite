abstract: In this letter, we propose a training approach combining
  hand-over-hand and trial and error training approaches and we evaluate its
  effectiveness for both robotic and standard laparoscopic surgical training.
  The proposed approach makes use of the data of an expert collected while using
  the da Vinci Surgical System. We present our data collection system and how we
  use it in the proposed training approach. We conduct two user studies (N = 21
  for each) to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. Our results show
  that subjects trained using this combined approach can better balance the
  speed and accuracy of their task execution compared with others trained using
  only one of either hand-over-hand or trial and error training approaches.
  Moreover, this combined approach leads to the best performance when it comes
  to the transferability of the acquired skills when testing on another task. We
  show that the results of the two studies are consistent with an established
  model in the literature for motor skill learning. Moreover, our results show
  for the first time the feasibility of using a surgical robot and data
  collected from it as a training platform for conventional laparoscopic surgery
  without robotic assistance.
