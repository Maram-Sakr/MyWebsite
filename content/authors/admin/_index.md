Maram Sakr is a joint Ph.D. student at the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of British Columbia, Canada and the Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University. Her doctorate research is about effective teaching for robot learning from demonstration. She is co-supervised by Prof. Elizabeth Croft, Prof. Dana Kulic and Dr. H.F. Machiel Van der Loos. She completed her MASc degree at the School of Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University, Canada. Her Master’s research was about using Force Myography for estimating user-applied force and torque. She received her B.Sc. degree in Computers and Systems Engineering from Mansoura University, Egypt. She is the recipient of the Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship from NSERC.

Maram's research aims to quantify the demonstration quality in robot learning from demonstration. In addition, it aims to provide training for everyday users on how to teach robots by demonstration and deploy Augmented Reality to visually guide users while teaching robots. Her goal is to allow everyday users to intuitively teach robots by demonstrations and provide high quality demonstrations for the robot to learn from.
